"Researchers have proven scientifically that humans are all 
one people...The color of our ancestors’ skin and ultimately 
my skin and your skin is a consequence of ultraviolet light, 
of latitude and climate. Despite our recent sad conflicts here 
in the U.S., there really is no such thing as race. We are one 
species—each of us much, much more alike than different. We all 
come from Africa. We all are of the same stardust. We are all 
going to live and die on the same planet, a Pale Blue Dot in the 
vastness of space. We have to work together." -Bill Nye
